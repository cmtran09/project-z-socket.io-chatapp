# project-z-socket.io-chatapp

https://project-z-socketio-chat-app.herokuapp.com/

## Overview
While developing project-4-doodle I saw the limitations of HTML requests to a server, most notably the speed that each request is made. With some research, I learned about Websockets and how that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive session between the user's browser and a server.

In this project, I created a simple chat room where users can join a room see who is currently in the room, their activity status and send messages to each other all in real-time.
